about_content: |
  When emergent technology radically changes the way we live and makes our work more productive, how can we ensure that everyone gets
  a piece of the bigger, more efficient pie? After starting my career as a field biologist investigating ecological change,
  I helped automate wildlife monitoring so that managers and conservation groups could gain more insight with less
  hassle - but it made me realize that, absent a forward-thinking policy agenda that gives displaced
  workers a dignified livelihood, these disruptive technologies would be resisted at all costs.
  

  <mark>I believe that through evidence-based labor, industrial, and tech policy iniatives, we can build a society that
  works for us all; one that is well adapted to address the grand challenges of the 21st century.</mark>
